# Pay protocol
(provisional name)

## Help

Until [aragon-core#160](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/pull/160) is
properly fixed and merged, to compile manually loose versions of dependency
contracts by finding and replacing `0.4.15` for `^0.4.15` in `node_modules/**/*.sol`

## Goals

- Make crypto p2p payments take over the world

(... under construction)

## Team

There is no team. Unfortunately no advisors either. 

The protocol shouldn't need a team to succeed.
